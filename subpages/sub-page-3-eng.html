            already seems to be already building up. The reason for this are the

            As in other countries, the development is due to the variants BA.4
            and BA.5 are to blame. "We can confirm that BA.4 and BA.5 were among
            the most last week (week 23) have become the dominant sub-variants

            20 Minuten. There are also indications that that the BA.5 variant is
            more frequent than BA.4, but the exact relationship between the two
            variants has yet to be confirmed by genome sequencing." Experts
            assume that the proportion of BA.5 in particular will continue to
            increase. According to the ECDC, BA.5 has a growth advantage over
            the BA.2 variant, which BA.2 variant has a growth advantage of 13

            South Africa and Portugal, where the two variants have caused a new
